This repo holds analyses used in the manuscript, "Insitutype: likelihood-based cell typing for single cell spatial transcriptomics".

How to use:
- Each folder holds a distinct analysis (Figure or sub-figure)
- The "Data" folder holds data used by any analysis. Some files in this folder are too big to be hosted on github, and are available upon request from the authors. 
- All R scripts execute in the directory in which they lie
- These analyses use a development version of Insitutype, "MLEcell". This package can be installed using the "environment_setup" script.
